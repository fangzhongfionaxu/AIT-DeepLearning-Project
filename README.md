## Project Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to predict flight ticket prices. Historically, many tradtional machine learning models such as KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Trees have been used for this task. We aim to assess whether deep learning, specifically RNN models, can add value through leveraging temporal dependencies in flight data, which can better capture intricate patterns and dynamic pricing mechanisms of the airline industry. Our dataset consists of nearly 6 million flight records from U.S. airlines between April and November 2022. Baseline models are Linear Regression and XGBoost, and deep learning models are GRU and LSTM. In short, this project aims to compare the performance of different models, enhance price prediction accuracy, optimize feature selection, and mitigate overfitting to ultimately contribute to more reliable airfare forecasting.
