## Project Abstract
This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to predict flight ticket prices. Historically, many tradtional machine learning models such as KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Trees have been used for this task. We aim to assess whether deep learning, specifically RNN models, can add value through leveraging temporal dependencies in flight data, which can better capture intricate patterns and dynamic pricing mechanisms of the airline industry. Our main dataset consists of nearly 6 million flight records from U.S. airlines between April and November 2022. Additional datasets of flights from India and Germany from different time periods are also used to evaluate model performance. The model is trained on a time-series forecasting approach, incorporating methods like ARIMA and GRU. We hope to address challenges such as generalization across different regions and time periods. In short, this project aims to enhance price prediction accuracy, optimize feature selection, and mitigate overfitting to ultimately contribute to more reliable airfare forecasting.
